		2021 is a special year for Fuhua family as we turn 80. To celebrate 
		the 8 decades of our contributions in developing generations of students 
		and serving the community, we held our e-celebrations on Fri 19 November.<br><br>

		Fuhua Primary School was established on 18 July 1941. Known originally 
		as Fu Hua Public School, it was started by a group of public-spirited 
		villagers who were determined to serve the community and provide the 
		best education for their children so that they would secure a bright 
		future. <br><br>

		Our school’s motto, “Frugality and Honesty” reflects the humble beginnings 
		of the school. With limited resources then, the founders strongly believed 
		in instilling the importance of frugality and gratitude in our young charges. 
		The Chinese saying “饮水思源” which means “remember the source of water” guided 
		them in their mission to raise the children for the future.<br><br>

		“Our Fuhua Story, 80 years and Beyond”, the theme of our school’s 
		80th anniversary celebrations could not be more apt to celebrate our 
		continued commitment in providing quality education for generations of students. 
		During our e-celebrations, we launched our e-Heritage production and a 
		Heritage corridor depicting the progress of our school and contributions 
		of our stakeholders comprising past and present staff, school advisory committee 
		members, alumni and parents without whom the school would not have achieved its many accolades.<br><br>

		The e-Heritage video, that features emergent technologies such as Augmented 
		Reality, 3-D illusion and our Applied Learning Programme that prepares 
		students to use technologies such as coding to solve real world problems, 
		are testament to the school’s commitment in harnessing technology 
		to create new possibilities.<br><br>

		The school’s Learning for Life Programme – Environment Education supports 
		the endeavour of developing Fuhua Gems to be environment ambassadors. 
		We will continue to support the nation’s sustainability movement aligned 
		to the SG Green Plan 2030 and UN Sustainable Development Goals through 
		our environment education programmes.<br><br>

		The world is evolving fast, and students must be equipped with the necessary 
		knowledge and skills to face the challenges of the future. A primary school 
		education anchored in strong fundamentals and values is necessary for our students 
		to thrive in the VUCA world. We will strive to design school experiences that will 
		bring about deeper learning to realise our student outcomes of Lifelong Learner, 
		Citizen Leader and Tech-Savvy Innovator.<br><br>

		I am grateful for my SAC members, Staff, Parents and partners-in- education for 
		giving their unrelenting support to the school in developing every 
		Fuhua Gem. May we stand united and scale to greater heights in our endeavours!<br><br>
